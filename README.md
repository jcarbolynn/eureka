text based adventure game using python

In 1961, two hydrogen bombs were ejected from a plane over North Carolina. In this game, one detonated.

It is now decades later and humans have avoided the area ever since. You are a scraggly adventurer who believes the time is ripe for exploration.

With no supplies, you venture into the nuclear exclusion zone. Here you find a variety of wildlife in need of your help and several puzzles along the way.
